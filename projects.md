      <p>@ CMEE, NUAA, Nanjing, 2018-2019</p>
      <p><li><b>Preliminary Design</b></li></p>
      <p style ="text-align:justify;">This project aimed at seeking a controllable variable-stiffness approach that could be utilized in medical continuum manipulator. Suppose equipped with a variable-stiffness mechanism, this manipulator was anticipated to be capable of continuously tuning its stiffness, thus safely navigating inside human body and reducing operational difficulty for surgeons.</p>
      <p style ="text-align:justify;">First, we designed a one-way variable-stiffness flexible manipulator that could be stiffened by the proactive deformation of shape memory alloy (SMA) wires, which were well suited for medical applications due to their apparent mechanical deformation capacity, suitable phase transformation temperature, easy miniaturization and crucial biocompatibility. The design, mathematical modeling, Finite Element Modeling (FEM) simulations and experimental characterizations of mechanism and single module were separately conducted. The results of stimulations and experiments demonstrated a good stiffening capacity of the designed manipulator.</p>
      <p style ="text-align:justify;">This study has been published in <b><i>Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part H: Journal of Engineering in Medicine</i></b>. <a class="button button--success button--pill button--xs" href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0954411918802922" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LINK</a></p>
      <p><li><b>Further Design</b></li></p>
      <p style ="text-align:justify;">On the ground of the aforementioned study, we further designed a continuum manipulator integrated with an SMA-based variable-stiffness sheath, whose stiffness was adjusted continuously in a two-way pattern as a voltage stimulus between both sheath ends ranged in a specific range, along with the phase transformations between austenite and martensite. Via a similar research method as aforementioned study, the validity of this variable-stiffness manipulator design was verified.</p>
      <p style ="text-align:justify;">The related outcome was presented at <i>2018 International Academic Conference for Graduates, NUAA (<b>IACGN</b>, 2018)</i>, and winded up honored with <b>Best Paper Award in 2018 IACGN</b>. <a class="button button--success button--pill button--xs" href="/assets/publications/journals/conference-iacgn_2018.pdf" download="IACGN2018_Volume5.pdf">LINK1</a> Then, after my M.

      <p style ="text-align:justify;">This project targeted at exploring an approach to track shapes of continuum robots in real time so that the robots could be controlled accurately so as to assure the safety of motion in unknown environments.</p>
      <p style ="text-align:justify;">We attempted a scheme that small permanent magnets and magnetic sensors were integrated into a continuum robot to estimate its shape change. By fitting magnets' relative bending angle data derived from sensors into the Quadratic BÃ©zier curve, we ended up reconstructing the shape in 2D plane. In addition, we performed simulation to reasonably arrange magnets and sensors to decrease the interference of multiple magnets. Afterwards, we carried out related experiments in a test platform including a single section prototype and a contrastive experiment platform to verify accuracy and feasibility of this method.</p>

      <p>@ CMEE, NUAA, Nanjing, 2017</p>
      <p style ="text-align:justify;">In this project, we anticipated to develop a tactile sensor capable of measuring hardness of soft tissues, so as to provide a detailed sense of touch for surgeons.</p>
      <p style ="text-align:justify;">We proposed a tactile sensor consisting of a piezoelectric ceramic plate, a spiral metal plate and a probe. In this design, only one piece of lead zirconate titanate (PZT) was used as both an actuator and a sensing element; a spiral metal plate was designed to reduce the resonant frequency of the sensor to restrict the impact brought by the effective mass of tissue. The concept structure and working principle of the proposed sensor were explained. FEM analyses including static structural analysis, modal analysis and harmonic response analysis were carried out to verify the feasibility of the sensor. Finally, a prototype and corresponding experimental system were established to further validate this feasibility. The experimental results ended up having a good agreement with the simulation results to assure this sensor's superb ability of lump detection.</p>

The team I served for supports a bunch series of HUAWEI's core products, like high-end communication devices named "NetEngine 8000 Series Routers" and stuff. I was mainly in charge of module development and maintenance of FMEA, related to periodically monitoring hardware failure and reporting alarms during equipment running. This assured the stability and reliability of equipments without impairing performance.</p>
      <p style ="text-align:justify;">Over two years or so, I have delivered <b>15+ product iterations</b> on developing new software requirements, during which I served as <b>iteration owner</b>. Meanwhile, I solved <b>500+ defect tracking sheets</b> (DTS) and won <b>Gold Network Award</b> for <b>3 times</b>, thus deeply appreciated by colleagues.</p>
