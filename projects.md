      <h4>Project 1: Variable Stiffness</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="item__description">
      <p><b>PI</b>. With Prof. Feng Ju and Prof. Bai Chen. </p>
      <p>@ CMEE, NUAA, Nanjing, 2018 - 2019</p>
      <p><li><b>Design A</b></li></p>
      <p style ="text-align:justify;">This project aimed at seeking a controllable variable-stiffness approach that could be utilized in medical continuum manipulator. Suppose equipped with variable-stiffness mechanism, this manipulator is anticipated to be capable of continuously tuning its stiffness, thus safely navigating inside human body and reducing operational difficulty for surgeon.</p>
      <p style ="text-align:justify;">First, we designed a one-way variable-stiffness flexible manipulator that can be stiffened by the proactive deformation of shape memory alloy (SMA) wires, which are well suited for medical applications due to their apparent mechanical deformation capacity, suitable phase transformation temperature, easy miniaturization and crucial biocompatibility. The design, mathematical modeling, Finite Element Modeling (FEM) simulations and experimental characterizations of mechanism and single module were separately conducted. The results of stimulations and experiments demonstrated a good stiffening capacity of the designed manipulator.</p>
      <p style ="text-align:justify;">This study has been published in <b><i>Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part H: Journal of Engineering in Medicine</i></b>.</p>

      </p>
      <p><li><b>Design B</b></li></p>
      <p style ="text-align:justify;">On the ground of the aforementioned study, we further designed a novel continuum manipulator with a SMA-based variable-stiffness sheath, whose stiffness was adjusted continuously in a two-way pattern as a voltage stimulus between both sheath ends ranged in a specific range, along with the phase transformations between austenite and martensite. Via similar research method as aforementioned study, the validity of this variable-stiffness manipulator design was verified.</p>
      <p style ="text-align:justify;">The related output was presented at <b><i>2018 International Academic Conference for Graduates, NUAA</i></b> (IACGN, 2018), and winded up honored with <b>the Best Paper Award in 2018 IACGN</b>. Then after my M. Sc. graduation from NUAA, it was further published in <b><i>the International Journal of Medical Robotics and Computer Assisted Surgery</i></b>.</p>

      <p>@ CMEE, NUAA, Nanjing, 2018</p>
      <p style ="text-align:justify;">I helped research in this sub-project, which was funded by the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities. We dedicated to providing a method of tracking the shape of CM itself greatly in real time. In our prototype, we integrated small magnets and magnetic sensors into a CM to carry out relevant researches.</p>

      <p>@ CMEE, NUAA, Nanjing, 2017</p>
      <p style ="text-align:justify;">I also assisted in studying tactile sensors in CM. The purpose was to measure hardness of soft tissues when surgical instruments like CMs are operated in MIS, to check whether safety can be guaranteed or not. In our design, only one piece of lead zirconate titanate (PZT) was used as both an actuator and a sensing element.</p>

      <p>@ HUAWEI, Nanjing, 2019 - 2021</p>
      <p style ="text-align:justify;">After my completion of M. Sc. in NUAA, I joined HUAWEI as a software engineer. The team I served for supports a bunch series of HUAWEI's core products, like high-end communication devices named "NetEngine 8000 Series Routers" and stuff. I was mainly in charge of module development and maintenance of FMEA, related to periodically monitoring hardware failure and reporting alarms during equipment running, so as to assure its stability and reliability without impairing performance.</p>
      <p style ="text-align:justify;">Over two years or so, I have delivered <b>15+ product iterations</b> of requirement development, during which I served as <b>iteration owner</b>. Meanwhile, I solved <b>500+ defect tracking sheets</b> (DTS) and won <b>Gold Network Award</b> for <b>3 times</b>, thus deeply appreciated by colleagues.</p>
