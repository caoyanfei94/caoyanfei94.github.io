I have been a software engineer for 2 years or so at the Department of Information and Communication Technology, **Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd.(HUAWEI)**.

I received my M. Sc. degree from the **Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics (NUAA)** in 2019. During my M. Sc. study, I worked at the College of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering (CMEE), NUAA, in Nanjing, Jiangsu Province, P. R. China.

My research interest is in the field of **Medical Robotics**, with particular emphasis on **variable stiffness**, **shape estimation** and **tactile sensing** technologies for **continuum manipulators** used in minimally invasive surgery (MIS). Meanwhile, I serve as a **reviewer** for prestigious journals such as Journal of Intelligent & Robotic Systems (JINT), Journal of Intelligent Material Systems and Structures (JIM), and the International Journal of Medical Robotics and Computer Assisted Surgery (RCS).

**Now, I am sincerely seeking an appropriate fully funded PhD position**. If you and your team are interested in me, please don't hesitate to send me an email: caoyanfei94@163.com. I have been prepared to join your team at any time! üåù
