      <p style ="text-align:justify;">Magnetic continuum robots (MCRs) have become popular owing to their inherent advantages of easy miniaturization without requiring complicated transmission structures. The evolution of MCRs, from initial designs with one embedded magnet to current designs with specific magnetization profile configurations (MPCs), has significantly enhanced their dexterity. While much progress has been achieved, the quantitative indexbased evaluation of deformability for different MPCs, which can assist in designing MPCs with enhanced robot deformability, has not been addressed before. Here we use "deformability" to describe the capability for body deflection when an MCR forms different global shapes under an external magnetic field. Therefore, in this paper, we propose methodologies to design and control an MCR composed of modular axially magnetized segments. To guide robot MPC design, for the first time, we introduce a quantitative index-based evaluation strategy to analyze and optimize robot deformability. Additionally, a control framework with neural network-based controllers is developed to endow the robot with two control modes: the robot tip position and orientation (M<sub>1</sub>) and the global shape (M<sub>2</sub>). The excellent performance of the learnt controllers in terms of computation time and accuracy was validated via both simulation and experimental platforms. In the experimental results, the best closed-loop control performance metrics, indicated as the mean absolute errors, were 0.254 mm and 0.626&deg for mode M<sub>1</sub> and 1.564 mm and 0.086&deg for mode M<sub>2</sub>.</p>

    <div class="item__description">
      <p>Done by <b>Y. Cao</b>, Z. Yang, B. Hao, X. Wang, M. Cai, Z. Qi, B. Sun, Q. Wang, L. Zhang*.</p>
      <p>@ MAE, CUHK, Hong Kong, 2022-2023</p>
      <p style ="text-align:justify;">Magnetic continuum robots (MCRs), which are free of complicated structural designs for transmission, can be miniaturized and are therefore widely used in the medical field. However, the deformation shapes of different segments, including deflection directions and curvatures, are difficult to control simultaneously under an external programmable magnetic field. This is because the latest MCRs have designs with an invariable magnetic moment combination or profile of one or more actuating units. Therefore, the limited dexterity of the deformation shape causes the existing MCRs to collide readily with their surroundings or makes them unable to approach difficult-to-reach regions. These prolonged collisions are unnecessary or even hazardous, especially for catheters or similar medical devices. In this study, a novel magnetic moment intraoperatively programmable continuum robot (MMPCR) is introduced. By applying the proposed magnetic moment programming method, the MMPCR can deform under three modalities, that is, J, C, and S shapes. Additionally, the deflection directions and curvatures of different segments in the MMPCR can be modulated as desired. Furthermore, the magnetic moment programming and MMPCR kinematics are modeled, numerically simulated, and experimentally validated. The experimental results exhibit a mean deflection angle error of 3.3&deg and correspond well with simulation results. Comparisons between navigation capacities of the MMPCR and MCR demonstrate that the MMPCR has a higher capacity for dexterous deformation.</p>

      <p><li><b>First Design</b></li></p>
      <p style ="text-align:justify;">This article presents a novel variable-stiffness flexible manipulator for minimally invasive surgery. Each module of the proposed manipulator contains a variable-stiffness mechanism actuated by proactive deformation of shape memory alloy. Due to low driving current, apparent mechanical deformation, suitable phase transformation temperature and biocompatibility of shape memory alloy wire actuation, it is well suited for the manipulator applied in minimally invasive surgery, where variable stiffness is urgently required. In this article, the conceptual design, elastic modulus model, thermo-electric model, stiffness controlling method and finite element method simulation for a single module of the proposed variable-stiffness flexible manipulator are presented. Moreover, the memory shape setting experiment of shape memory alloy wire and fabrication of the single module are carried out. Finally, stiffness characterizations of the mechanism and the single module are studied separately, theoretically and experimentally.</p>

      <p><li><b>Further Design</b></li></p>
      <p style ="text-align:justify;">Due to its unique dexterity and safety, continuum manipulators have been widely used in small constrained environment. However, its flexibility also brings negative effects such as poor stiffness and low strength. This paper presents a novel variable-stiffness sheath for continuum manipulators applied in minimally invasive surgery. We present a variable-stiffness sheath based on shape memory alloy (SMA) for each module of the continuum manipulators. The stiffness of the sheath can be continuously adjusted depending on the voltage between both ends of the sheath, along with the phase transformation of SMA between austenite and martensite. The experimental results demonstrate that the stiffness of the sheath and single module are able to increase up to 223.1% and 139.2%, separately, which verify the correctness of the proposed variable stiffness method. The robot integrated with the variable-stiffness sheath is demonstrated to possess a fine capacity of variable stiffness.</p>

      <p>@ CMEE, NUAA, Nanjing, 2018</p>
      <p style ="text-align:justify;">This project targeted at exploring an approach to track shapes of continuum robots in real time so that the robots could be controlled accurately so as to assure the safety of motion in unknown environments.</p>
      <p style ="text-align:justify;">We attempted a scheme that small permanent magnets and magnetic sensors were integrated into a continuum robot to estimate its shape change. By fitting magnets' relative bending angle data derived from sensors into the Quadratic Bézier curve, we ended up reconstructing the shape in 2D plane. In addition, we performed simulation to reasonably arrange magnets and sensors to decrease the interference of multiple magnets. Afterwards, we carried out related experiments in a test platform including a single section prototype and a contrastive experiment platform to verify accuracy and feasibility of this method.</p>

    <div class="item__description">
      <p><b>Member</b>. with Mr. Lei Zhang, Prof. Feng Ju, and Prof. Bai Chen.</p>
      <p>@ CMEE, NUAA, Nanjing, 2017</p>
      <p style ="text-align:justify;">In this project, we anticipated to develop a tactile sensor capable of measuring hardness of soft tissues, so as to provide a detailed sense of touch for surgeons.</p>
      <p style ="text-align:justify;">We proposed a tactile sensor consisting of a piezoelectric ceramic plate, a spiral metal plate and a probe. In this design, only one piece of lead zirconate titanate (PZT) was used as both an actuator and a sensing element; a spiral metal plate was designed to reduce the resonant frequency of the sensor to restrict the impact brought by the effective mass of tissue. The concept structure and working principle of the proposed sensor were explained. FEM analyses including static structural analysis, modal analysis and harmonic response analysis were carried out to verify the feasibility of the sensor. Finally, a prototype and corresponding experimental system were established to further validate this feasibility. The experimental results ended up having a good agreement with the simulation results to assure this sensor's superb ability of lump detection.</p>
