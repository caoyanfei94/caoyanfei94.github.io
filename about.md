<img class="shadow" src="/assets/about/CYF.png" height="200" width="auto" style="border-radius:25%; float: right; margin-left: 30px; margin-bottom: 30px" />

<p style ="text-align:justify;">I have received my M. Sc. degree from the <b>Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics</b> (<a href="https://www.nuaa.edu.cn/479/list.htm" style="color:#0066CC" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NUAA</a>) since 2019. During my M. Sc. study, I worked at the College of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering (<a href="http://cmee.nuaa.edu.cn/eng/13604/list.htm" style="color:#0066CC" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CMEE</a>), NUAA, in Nanjing, Jiangsu Province, P. R. China. After that, I worked as a software engineer for 2 years or so at the Department of Information and Communication Technology, <B>Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd.</b> (<a href="https://www.huawei.com/en/corporate-information" style="color:#0066CC" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HUAWEI</a>).</p>

<p style ="text-align:justify;">My research interest is in the field of <b>Medical Robotics</b>, with particular emphasis on <b>variable stiffness</b>, <b>shape estimation</b> and <b>tactile sensing</b> technologies for <b>continuum manipulators</b> used in minimally invasive surgery (MIS). Meanwhile, I serve as a <b>reviewer</b> for prestigious journals such as <i>Journal of Intelligent & Robotic Systems</i> (JINT), <i>Journal of Intelligent Material Systems and Structures</i> (JIM), and <i>the International Journal of Medical Robotics and Computer Assisted Surgery</i> (RCS).</p>
